🏗 Architecture
Pattern	Usage
Singleton	DataManager — single source of truth
MVC	Models (Student/Room), Views (Panels), Controller (DataManager)
Observer	Panels call refresh() on navigation
Factory	Button/card creation helper methods
📦 Sample Data
The system loads with sample data on startup:

15 Rooms: Block A (Male) and Block B (Female), floors 1-3
8 Students: Mixed genders, courses, years
5 Pre-allocations: Showing real usage
🛠 Technical Details
Language: Pure Java (JDK 8+)
GUI Framework: Java Swing
Custom Rendering: All buttons, tables, and cards use custom paintComponent()
No external dependencies: Zero external libraries needed
Data Storage: In-memory (no database — data resets on restart)
📌 Limitations & Future Enhancements
 Add database persistence (MySQL / SQLite)
 Export reports to PDF/Excel
 Fee management module
 Email notifications
 Multi-admin support with roles
 Room swap functionality
